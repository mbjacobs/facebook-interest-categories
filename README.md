# Facebook Interest Categories

## Problem Statement
Facebook, like many social networking platforms, collects and shares large amounts of personal data with third parties, such as data brokers and third party advertisers, based on the content that its algorithms perceive as interesting or relevant to individual users. However, Facebook’s privacy settings are notoriously difficult to notice and navigate. Most users rarely investigate what assumptions that Facebook is making about them based on their online engagement.  My overall goal was to illustrate the detailed and yet inaccurate nature of targeted advertising. I aimed create something artistic to serve as visual commentary about the assumptions drawn from data collection and on social media platforms.

## Design
The [initial implementation](https://mbjacobs.github.io/si579-05problemset/) of the website was completed using a combination of vanilla HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for the layout. Additional third party JavaScript libraries included jQuery and Lodash. I built upon this base by implementing greater interactivity and a more unique way to visualize my own targeted advertising data from Facebook. 

## Implementation
I planned to gain more experience with vector-based drawing libraries in JavaScript. Specifically, I wanted to use a vector graphics library to improve upon my existing Facebook Interest Categories project. The initial project displayed and filtered colored squares based upon their relevance.

Using [SnapSVG.js](http://snapsvg.io/), I have created a more interactive visualization with the dataset of Facebook interest categories I’ve collected.
